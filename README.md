## Overview

It includes sections for different types of animals such as mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.  
The design is neat, scrollable, and easy to navigate.

## HTML Explanation  
- The `<header>` tag contains the website title **"Wildlife Watch"** and a small contact section.  
- The `<nav>` tag includes navigation links to different sections like **Home, Mammals, Birds**, etc.  
- The `<section>` tags divide the content into different parts such as **mammals**, **birds**, **reptiles**, and **amphibians**.  
- Each section has several **animal cards** created using `<div class="animal-card">`.  
  - Each card contains an **image (`<img>`)** and a short **description (`<p>`)**.  
- The `<footer>` is divided into two parts:  
  - The first part has **language**, **donation currency**, and **organization info**.  
  - The second part shows **copyright**.

## CSS Explanation  
- Used `*{ margin:0; padding:0; box-sizing:border-box; }` to reset browser defaults.  
- Used **Flexbox** in the header, navigation bar, and footer for alignment.
